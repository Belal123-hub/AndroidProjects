Hi)
because i decided to start this app using the clean archetechture with 3 different modules:
domain,data,App(UI)
i had to use for that the dependency injection so i chose to work with Koin which was very confusing but interesting in the same time)
and that unfortuantely took a lot of time because it's my first time to work with koin and clean archetechture

so that's why i still didn't finish the app fully and still a little work
and here what i have done :

1 -authorization (signIn and SignUp and i added the full logic for logout)
2-i added one more feature to my app if the user login or signs up he will not have to do that again and when he oppens the app he will be directed to th Main screen (that was by creating kind of database to hold that)

3- going to profile and there user can give his info but unfortuantely can't send the profile which i will add soon to github.

4-in the maing shows all users with their cards and user can swipe and like and dislike and by liking he will create new chat and if other user 
likes back he will be in the chatlist

5- then profile info where you can see the user's info

6- and from the Profile Info user can come back to Profile screen and edit his info
7- the chat unfortuantely i did the chatlist successfully but i am still working on the messages screen and i just did the UI and viewmodel but still didn't finish with the Api
